üè† Real Estate Price Prediction Project

This project demonstrates the development of a machine learning model to predict real estate prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other property-related attributes.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the price of houses using a dataset of historical real estate sales. The model uses supervised learning techniques to provide accurate price predictions for new data inputs. Key techniques include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the application of machine learning algorithms.

 Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing relationships between different features and the target variable
  Machine Learning Models: Linear regression, decision tree, and random forest algorithms implemented for prediction
- Model Evaluation: Using performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared to evaluate models

 Technologies Used
- Python: Core programming language
- Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for code development
